# PR-002: Database Models and Core Operations

## Overview
**Size**: ~350 lines | **Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Primary Agent**: mongodb-manager

Implement MongoDB document models and basic CRUD operations for the Blog Reviewer system.

## Description
Design and implement core database models (Article, Author, Review, User) with comprehensive CRUD operations, data validation, indexing strategy, and database connection management. This PR establishes the data layer foundation for the entire system.

## Tasks
- [ ] Design and implement Article model with complete schema validation
- [ ] Design and implement Author model with style profiling capabilities  
- [ ] Design and implement Review model with workflow status tracking
- [ ] Design and implement User model for authentication system
- [ ] Create robust database connection management and configuration
- [ ] Implement comprehensive CRUD operations for each model
- [ ] Set up optimized database indexes for query performance
- [ ] Create data validation schemas with error handling
- [ ] Implement database migration system for schema evolution
- [ ] Add database health checks and monitoring utilities

## Testing Requirements
Following testing_strategy.md for Database Models and Operations:

### Unit Tests (100% coverage required)
- [ ] Test model creation with valid data for all models
- [ ] Test model validation rejects invalid data appropriately
- [ ] Test CRUD operations with mocked database connections
- [ ] Test data transformation and serialization logic
- [ ] Test error handling for validation failures
- [ ] Test relationship handling between models
- [ ] Test database connection management and configuration

### Integration Tests (100% coverage required)
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations with real MongoDB instance
- [ ] Test model relationships and data integrity constraints
- [ ] Test database indexes improve query performance measurably
- [ ] Test concurrent operations and data consistency
- [ ] Test error handling for database connection failures
- [ ] Test migration system with schema changes
- [ ] Test database health checks and monitoring

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Benchmark CRUD operations meet < 50ms requirement
- [ ] Test bulk operations handle 1000+ records efficiently
- [ ] Validate index usage with query performance analysis
- [ ] Test concurrent access and connection pooling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All models (Article, Author, Review, User) can be created, read, updated, deleted
- [ ] Data validation prevents invalid documents from being stored
- [ ] Database indexes demonstrate measurable query performance improvements
- [ ] Proper error handling for all database operation failures
- [ ] Database operations are atomic where data integrity is required
- [ ] Migration system can handle schema evolution safely
- [ ] Connection management handles pool limits and failures gracefully
- [ ] Database health checks provide accurate service status

  "updated_at": Date
}
```

### Review Model
```python
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "article_id": ObjectId,             # Reference to articles
  "workflow_status": {
    "current_phase": String,          # "setup", "analyzing", "completed"

```

### Database Operations
- **Connection Management**: Async MongoDB client with connection pooling
- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, Delete for all models
- **Query Optimization**: Proper indexing strategy for common queries
- **Data Validation**: Schema validation using Pydantic models
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Performance Requirements
- CRUD operations: < 50ms response time
- Complex queries: < 200ms response time
- Bulk operations: Handle 1000+ records efficiently
- Connection pooling: Support 50+ concurrent connections

## Index Strategy
```javascript
// Articles collection
db.articles.createIndex({ "author_id": 1 })
db.articles.createIndex({ "article_type": 1, "review_status": 1 })
db.articles.createIndex({ "is_current": 1, "created_at": -1 })
db.articles.createIndex({ "title": "text", "content": "text" })

// Authors collection  
db.authors.createIndex({ "name": 1 }, { unique: true })
db.authors.createIndex({ "author_type": 1 })

// Reviews collection
db.reviews.createIndex({ "article_id": 1 })
db.reviews.createIndex({ "workflow_status.current_phase": 1 })
db.reviews.createIndex({ "created_at": -1 })
```

## Dependencies
- **PR-001**: Requires Docker and MongoDB infrastructure to be set up
- **MongoDB**: Version 6.0+ running and accessible
- **Python**: Motor (async MongoDB driver) and Pydantic for validation

## Claude Code Agent Guidance
Use the **mongodb-manager** agent for:
- Database schema design and document structure
- MongoDB indexing strategy and query optimization  
- CRUD operation implementation patterns
- Data validation and error handling strategies
- Database connection management and performance tuning

Ask the mongodb-manager agent specific questions like:
- "Design optimal MongoDB schema for blog review system with Article, Author, Review, and User models"
- "Create efficient CRUD operations with proper error handling for these document models"
- "Recommend indexing strategy for common query patterns in blog review workflow"
- "Implement database migration system for schema evolution"

- **Blocks**: PR-005 (Review Orchestrator needs Review model)
- **Blocks**: PR-007 (Authentication needs User model)
