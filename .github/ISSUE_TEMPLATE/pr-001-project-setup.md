# PR-001: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Overview
**Size**: ~300 lines | **Duration**: 1-2 days  
**Primary Agent**: docker-deployer

Establish project foundation with Docker, MongoDB, and testing framework.

## Description
Set up the core infrastructure for the Blog Reviewer system including containerization, database services, testing framework, and CI/CD pipeline. This PR establishes the foundation that all other development will build upon.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create complete project directory structure following project plan
- [ ] Set up Docker and docker-compose configurations for development environment
- [ ] Configure MongoDB service with proper initialization scripts
- [ ] Set up pytest configuration with async support and coverage reporting
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [ ] Configure environment variable management with .env support
- [ ] Add basic health check endpoints for service monitoring
- [ ] Create development documentation and setup instructions

## Testing Requirements
Following testing_strategy.md for Infrastructure Features:

### Unit Tests (70% coverage minimum)
- [ ] Test Docker service configuration validation
- [ ] Test environment variable loading and validation
- [ ] Test configuration management utilities

### Integration Tests (90% coverage)
- [ ] Test Docker containers start successfully without errors
- [ ] Test MongoDB connection health and basic operations
- [ ] Test service integration and health checks
- [ ] Test environment configuration loads correctly across services

### Infrastructure Tests
- [ ] Verify all Docker services start and are accessible
- [ ] Verify MongoDB accepts connections and basic queries
- [ ] Verify test environment runs `pytest` without configuration errors
- [ ] Verify CI pipeline executes and reports results correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `docker-compose up` starts all services without errors
- [ ] MongoDB is accessible on localhost:27017 and accepts basic operations
- [ ] `pytest` command runs successfully and shows proper test discovery
- [ ] Environment variables are properly managed and validated
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline triggers on push/PR and reports test results
- [ ] Health check endpoints return appropriate status information
- [ ] Development setup documentation is complete and accurate

### Docker Services
- **MongoDB**: Version 6.0 with development configuration
- **Health checks**: For all services
- **Volume mounting**: For development and data persistence
- **Environment variables**: Properly configured and documented

### Testing Framework
- **pytest** with asyncio support
- **Coverage reporting** with minimum thresholds
- **Test discovery** configured for project structure
- **Parallel execution** support for faster testing

## Performance Requirements
- Docker services start in < 30 seconds
- MongoDB connection established in < 5 seconds
- Test suite discovery completes in < 3 seconds
- CI pipeline setup and execution in < 5 minutes

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] Development environment setup guide
- [ ] Docker service documentation
- [ ] Environment variable documentation

## Claude Code Agent Guidance
Use the **docker-deployer** agent for:
- Docker and docker-compose configuration design
- Container orchestration best practices
- Environment variable and secrets management
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Infrastructure monitoring and health checks

Ask the docker-deployer agent specific questions like:
- "Help me design a docker-compose configuration for development with MongoDB, including proper health checks and volume mounting"
- "Create a GitHub Actions workflow for running tests with MongoDB service"
- "Design environment variable management strategy for different deployment environments"

## Dependencies
None - this is the foundation PR
