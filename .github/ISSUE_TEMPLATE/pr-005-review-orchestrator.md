- [ ] Add workflow monitoring and logging
- [ ] Create error handling and recovery
- [ ] Implement workflow retry mechanisms
- [ ] Add performance metrics collection
- [ ] Create workflow visualization tools
- [ ] Test workflow state transitions
- [ ] Test task scheduling accuracy
- [ ] Test priority-based processing
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery
- [ ] Test workflow retry mechanisms
- [ ] Test performance under load
- [ ] Verify workflow completes correctly
- [ ] Verify state management is consistent
