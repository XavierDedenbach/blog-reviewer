# PR-005: Review Workflow Orchestrator

## Overview
**Size**: ~350 lines | **Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Primary Agent**: review-orchestrator

Implement the central coordination system for multi-stage blog review workflow with parallel processing capabilities.

## Description
Build the core orchestration system that coordinates the complete blog review process. This system manages the sequential setup phase followed by parallel analysis (purpose, style, grammar), handles state transitions, tracks progress, and compiles final reports while ensuring reliable execution and error recovery.

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement comprehensive review state machine with proper state transitions
- [ ] Create parallel task execution system for purpose, style, and grammar analysis
- [ ] Build detailed progress tracking with real-time status updates
- [ ] Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms for failed analyses
- [ ] Create report compilation system that synthesizes multiple analysis results
- [ ] Add workflow customization based on review parameters and requirements
- [ ] Implement review validation and quality assurance checks
- [ ] Create workflow analytics and performance monitoring
- [ ] Add integration points with all analysis services (content, scraping, database)
- [ ] Implement review workflow caching and result optimization

## Testing Requirements
Following testing_strategy.md for Workflow Orchestration Features:

### Unit Tests (95% coverage minimum)

## Claude Code Agent Guidance
Use the **review-orchestrator** agent for:
- Workflow coordination patterns and state machine design
- Parallel processing optimization and task scheduling
- Error handling strategies and recovery mechanisms
- Progress tracking implementation and real-time updates
- Performance optimization for complex workflows

Ask the review-orchestrator agent specific questions like:
- "Design a robust state machine for blog review workflow with proper error handling"
- "Implement parallel task coordination that optimizes processing time while handling failures"
- "Create progress tracking system that provides accurate real-time status updates"
- "Design error recovery mechanisms for partial failures in multi-component workflows"

## Related Issues
- **Depends on**: PR-001 (Infrastructure), PR-002 (Database), PR-003 (Content Analysis)
- **Blocks**: PR-010 (Review Management API), PR-013 (Advanced orchestration), PR-015 (System integration)
