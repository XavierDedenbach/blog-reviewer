# PR-003: Content Analysis Engine

## Overview
**Size**: ~400 lines | **Duration**: 3-4 days  
**Primary Agent**: content-analyzer

Build comprehensive content parsing and analysis system for blog content evaluation.

## Description
Implement the core content analysis engine that parses blog content, analyzes writing style, generates purpose-driven questions, and provides quality scoring. This system forms the foundation for the AI-powered blog review capabilities.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create robust markdown content parser with metadata extraction
- [ ] Implement comprehensive content structure analysis (headings, sections, flow)
- [ ] Build writing style analysis algorithms (tone, complexity, voice)
- [ ] Create purpose-based question generation system using AI models
- [ ] Implement content quality scoring with multiple metrics
- [ ] Add support for different content formats (markdown, HTML, plain text)
- [ ] Create content preprocessing and normalization utilities
- [ ] Implement caching system for analysis results
- [ ] Add content analysis result storage integration
- [ ] Create analysis configuration and customization system

## Testing Requirements
Following testing_strategy.md for Content Analysis Features:

### Unit Tests (85% coverage minimum)
- [ ] Test markdown parsing with various content structures and edge cases
- [ ] Test content structure analysis identifies sections, headings, lists correctly
- [ ] Test writing style analysis produces consistent results
- [ ] Test purpose question generation relevance and quality
- [ ] Test content quality scoring algorithms with known good/bad examples
- [ ] Test error handling for malformed content (broken markdown, empty files)
- [ ] Test content preprocessing and normalization functions
- [ ] Test analysis result serialization and deserialization

### Integration Tests (90% coverage)
- [ ] Test content analysis with real blog content samples
- [ ] Test integration with database storage for analysis results
- [ ] Test performance with large documents (up to 10,000 words)
- [ ] Test analysis consistency across multiple runs
- [ ] Test caching system improves performance for repeated analysis
- [ ] Test AI model integration for question generation
- [ ] Test content format conversion and normalization

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Small articles (< 1000 words): < 10 seconds analysis time
- [ ] Large articles (< 10000 words): < 30 seconds analysis time  
- [ ] Concurrent analysis: Handle 10+ articles simultaneously
- [ ] Memory usage remains reasonable for large content processing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can parse markdown content and extract metadata accurately
- [ ] Identifies content structure (headings, sections, word count, reading time)
- [ ] Generates relevant, purpose-specific evaluation questions
- [ ] Produces consistent and useful writing style analysis scores
- [ ] Content quality metrics correlate with manual assessment
- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully without crashing (malformed content, empty files)
- [ ] Performance meets specified requirements for content processing
- [ ] Analysis results can be cached and retrieved efficiently
- [ ] Integration with database storage works correctly

## Technical Specifications

### Content Parser
```python
class ContentParser:
    def parse(self, content: str, format: str = "markdown") -> ContentStructure:
        """Parse content and extract structure and metadata."""
        
    def extract_metadata(self, content: str) -> ContentMetadata:
        """Extract frontmatter and document metadata."""
        
    def normalize_content(self, content: str) -> str:
        """Clean and normalize content for analysis."""
```

### Style Analyzer  
```python
class StyleAnalyzer:
    def analyze_tone(self, content: str) -> ToneAnalysis:
        """Analyze writing tone (conversational, formal, technical)."""
        
    def analyze_complexity(self, content: str) -> ComplexityAnalysis:
        """Measure vocabulary and sentence complexity."""
        
    def analyze_structure(self, content: str) -> StructureAnalysis:
        """Analyze document organization and flow."""
```

### Question Generator
```python
class QuestionGenerator:
    def generate_purpose_questions(self, content: str, purpose: str) -> List[str]:
        """Generate 3-5 evaluation questions based on article purpose."""
        
    def validate_question_relevance(self, questions: List[str], content: str) -> List[float]:
        """Score question relevance to content."""
```

### Analysis Result Format
```python

    "word_count": int,
    "reading_time_minutes": int,
    "paragraph_count": int,
    "section_count": int,
    "readability_score": float

  "style_profile": {
    "tone": str,                    # "conversational", "formal", "technical"
    "complexity_rating": str,       # "simple", "medium", "complex"
    "voice_strength": float,        # 1-10 score
    "consistency_score": float      # 1-10 score
  },

### Content Processing Pipeline
1. **Input Validation**: Verify content format and basic structure
2. **Content Parsing**: Extract structure, metadata, and normalize text
3. **Style Analysis**: Analyze tone, complexity, and writing patterns  
4. **Structure Analysis**: Evaluate organization, flow, and readability
5. **Question Generation**: Create purpose-specific evaluation questions
6. **Quality Scoring**: Generate overall quality and component scores
7. **Result Storage**: Cache and store analysis results for retrieval

### AI Model Integration
- Use for advanced question generation based on content purpose
- Implement fallback methods for when AI models are unavailable
- Cache AI model responses to improve performance and reduce costs
- Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully

## Performance Requirements
- Content parsing: < 2 seconds for typical blog posts
- Style analysis: < 5 seconds for comprehensive analysis  
- Question generation: < 10 seconds including AI model calls
- Total analysis: < 30 seconds for articles up to 10,000 words
- Memory usage: < 500MB for large document processing
- Concurrent processing: Support 10+ parallel analyses

## Dependencies
- **PR-001**: Requires project infrastructure and testing framework
- **PR-002**: May integrate with database models for result storage
- **Python Libraries**: markdown, beautifulsoup4, nltk, textstat, pydantic
- **AI Models**: OpenRouter API integration for question generation

## Claude Code Agent Guidance
Use the **content-analyzer** agent for:
- Content parsing algorithm design and text processing
- Writing style analysis methodology and metrics
- NLP techniques for content structure analysis  
- Question generation strategies and validation
- Content quality scoring algorithm development

Ask the content-analyzer agent specific questions like:
- "Design a robust markdown parser that handles edge cases and extracts metadata"
- "Create writing style analysis algorithms that measure tone, complexity, and voice consistency"
- "Implement purpose-based question generation system for blog content evaluation"
- "Design content quality scoring metrics that correlate with human assessment"

## Related Issues
- **Depends on**: PR-001 (Infrastructure), PR-002 (Database models for storage)
- **Blocks**: PR-005 (Review Orchestrator needs content analysis), PR-009 (Article Management API)
