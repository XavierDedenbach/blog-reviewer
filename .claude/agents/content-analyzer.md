3. **Content Inventory**: Count words, paragraphs, sections, images
4. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract title, author, publication info if available

### Phase 2: Content Analysis
1. **Readability Assessment**: Evaluate sentence length, vocabulary complexity
2. **Structure Evaluation**: Analyze logical flow and organization
3. **Key Point Identification**: Extract main arguments and supporting evidence
4. **Example Analysis**: Identify and evaluate use of examples, analogies, case studies

### Phase 3: Style Profiling
1. **Tone Classification**: Determine overall tone and voice
2. **Complexity Scoring**: Rate content complexity (1-10 scale)
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring stylistic patterns
4. **Audience Assessment**: Evaluate content appropriateness for intended audience

### Phase 4: Purpose Alignment
1. **Intent Analysis**: Determine article's primary purpose and goals
2. **Question Generation**: Create purpose-specific evaluation questions

## Reference Material Integration

### Author Style Comparison
When provided with author reference materials:

1. **Style Profile Extraction**: Analyze reference articles for consistent patterns
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare target content against author's established style
3. **Consistency Scoring**: Rate how well content matches author's typical approach
4. **Style Recommendations**: Suggest adjustments to better align with author voice
