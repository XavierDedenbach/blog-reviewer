## Claude Code Agent Usage

### When to Use Agents
- **mongodb-manager**: Database schemas, complex queries, performance optimization
- **content-analyzer**: Content parsing algorithms, text analysis, NLP tasks
- **external-scraper**: Web scraping logic, API integrations, rate limiting
- **review-orchestrator**: Workflow coordination, parallel processing, state management
- **api-developer**: FastAPI endpoints, request/response models, authentication
- **docker-deployer**: Container configuration, deployment scripts, environment setup

### How to Work with Agents
1. **Be specific**: Ask for help with concrete tasks within the agent's domain
2. **Provide context**: Share relevant code, requirements, and constraints
3. **Review and iterate**: Use agent output as starting point, refine as needed
4. **Test integration**: Ensure agent-generated code integrates properly with existing system

2. **Write failing tests**: Create tests that verify the desired behavior
3. **Run tests**: Confirm tests fail as expected
4. **Implement code**: Write minimal code to pass tests
5. **Refactor**: Clean up code while maintaining test coverage
6. **Integrate**: Ensure changes work with existing system

### Claude Code Agent Usage
- **Use agents for complex domain tasks**: Don't ask agents to do simple file operations
- **Provide specific context**: Share requirements, existing code, and constraints
- **Iterate on solutions**: Use agent output as starting point, refine based on testing
- **Focus on integration**: Ensure agent-generated code integrates with existing system

### PR Submission Requirements
- [ ] All tests pass with required coverage
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation updated for API/behavior changes
- [ ] Performance impact assessed and acceptable
- [ ] Security implications considered and addressed
- [ ] Integration with existing system verified

This plan provides clear, actionable PRs that build incrementally toward a complete, production-ready blog review system.
